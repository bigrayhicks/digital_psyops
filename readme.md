# Overview

This class will explore the history and present-day manifestation of "psychological operations" - campaigns designed to influence populations for specific outcomes. Our definition of "psyops" is fairly broad in this course. We'll to the military and corporate development of these influence campaigns, what techniques and tactics are used, and examine how these practices are changing with the internet and social media.

The structure of this class will be a bit experimental. __Students will form small teams and identify a research question or project related to the subject of contemporary psyops.__ For example, it could be a network map of bot accounts on Twitter, or developing a Twitter bot to engage with other bots. __These research projects should involve some amount of programming.__

__Students are _not_ expected to have programming skills prior to this class__. In parallel with our exploration of the history, theory, and techniques, we'll devote some class time to building these programming skills. Plenty of in-class time will be provided for students to work on these projects. I will be available to answer any questions.

A Python workshop will run in parallel at the start of the course. It is not required but strongly recommended as we will not have enough time to cover foundational programming topics in great detail. The workshop will fill in the gaps and provide an opportunity to ask questions.

In addition to these research projects, the class will involve readings and discussions.

Note that because this course is new and experimental, the syllabus may be adjusted throughout the semester.
